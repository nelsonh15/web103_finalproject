## About

### Description and Purpose

The app is aimed towards aspiring software engineers who want to prepare for interviews that rely heavily on leetcode style coding problems, system design and behavioral. Instead of a human-to-human interaction, the app will introduce an AI that plays the role of the interviewer and it will simulate an interview environment, which can provide self-learning and personal growth for the user.

### Inspiration

Interviewing for a software engineering position can be very complex and it may take many months for a person to prepare. One can seek interview practice with a professional from the industry or from a program that specializes in tech interviews. However, many people may not have access to these networks. This app will make it easier for people to gain quality interview practice with the use of an AI-powered chatbot, which users can access at any time of the day.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: NextJS, Material UI

Backend: Neon, Prisma, AWS, OpenAI API

## Features

### Technical Interview Prep

This feature should include a code editor, a random leetcode style problem (difficulty can be chosen by the user) and a timer (can be set by the user). The user can solve this problem with any programming language of their choice. There will also be a short followup question where users will have to choose what is the time and space complexity of their solution. There will be a relational database that stores the user's data at the end of each interview session. The data will include the user's time spent per question, topic of the problem, if the user successfully solved the problem and the quality of the user's responses, which can be determined with ChatGPT.

### Interview History and Analytics

This feature should include a dashboard where users can see their past sessions, track their progress, and identify areas where they are improving or need more focus. Some data this dashboard would contain would be the user's average time spent per question, topics most practiced and success rate, which can be calculated by the user's passed test cases / total test cases. There will also be a database in the backend that stores this data, so that it can be easily retrieved for the frontend.

### AI-powered Interview Feedback

This feature will provide AI-generated feedback for the user at the end of each interview session. The feedback will analyze code correctness, efficiency, and the quality of responses for the user's coding solution. There will also be a performance score or rating.
