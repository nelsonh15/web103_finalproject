## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
The team was able to communicate effectively and develop a solid plan on how each features can be implemented to the app. In addition, we also discussed on the roles each member will have and how we will use our skills effectively in order to complete the project in a timely and efficient manner. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
There may be certain features in our app that may be too complex to complete within a 3 week timeframe. So, we'll prioritize on the must-do features and if there is still time, we can try to implement the stretch features of the app.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?
We will prioritize our remaining tasks by implementing the required features of the project first. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
Any user stories that relates to coding interviews might be "at risk". Initially, we wanted to implement that feature by introducing a code editor and the user would try to solve some coding problems with the editor and they can check to see if their code passes all the cases. However, we realized that this may be difficult to implement, so we resorted to having the user answer a set of questions related to coding, which would be easier to implement. If there's time left, we will definitely try to implement the former. 

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We might need access to certain docoumentation or resources online that will help us in our project. For instance, implementing a text-to-speech or speech-to-text feature is a very complex thing to do, so utilizing resources online could definitely make it easier for us.
