## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
The team worked collaboratively and communicated effectively on Slack to ensure we tackled all the required app features. Each member had clearly defined roles and we all brought innovative ideas to the table that wouldn't have been possible without our open communication. In addition, we made excellent use of the project board, so that everyone is in sync and every member knows exactly what needed to be done and when.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
Some features of the app were so challenging to implement that they significantly slowed our progress on the next stages. For example, we had trouble adding the speech-to-text functionality until we first tackled the critical feature allowing users to submit input responses. There were some bugs regarding parsing through the AI-generated responses. We needed the AI-generated responses to be in a certain format, so that we can add these data to the database. Fixing these bugs took a lot of time, but we pulled through.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?
We finished all of the planned tasks for this week and still had more time to think of other features we could improve on. Overall, it was a good collaborative effort and everybody learned a lot from implementing a project of this caliber.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?
I grown a lot in this course. We learned a lot of new technologies and we even improved our knowledge on the technologies that we knew before. It was also a plus to be a part of a group setting, where we have to use our soft skills and apply certain software engineering practices to complete a project on time and with the maximum quality.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?
We hope to continue learning more technologies in web development. The field is constantly evolving with new technologies being released, and with the rise in AI, that trend would continue to trend upwards. So, we will continue to learn by participating in coding bootcamps like CodePath and create projects that have a significant impact to society.
