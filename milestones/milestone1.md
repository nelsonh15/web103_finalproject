## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
We discussed the tech stacks that will be used for this project and how each team member can contribute a specific part of this project to the best of their abilities. We also discussed how we will implement the required features, as well as the potential features we will be adding on our own.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
One challenge our group faced was figuring out what our tech stack should be. Each member of the group comes from different background and some members possess technical skills that another one may not possess. So, it was necessary to discuss how we should work on this project and utilize certain roles so that all of us can work with a tool we are comfortable in. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We might need access to certain docoumentation or resources online that will help us in our project. For instance, implementing a text-to-speech or speech-to-text feature is a very complex thing to do, so utilizing resources online could definitely make it easier for us.
