## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
The team was able to effectively discuss what features our project will contain. The conversation was productive and everybody contributed to the talk. We discussed the database that will be used in the application and what features it will contain. We were also able to discuss our roles for the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
There were a bit of conflict regarding what features we should include in the project and whether or not the features were too complex to implement given our skillset. Fortunately, we were able to reach an agreement on what kind of features we will implement, so that all members can contribute to the project effectively. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We might need access to certain docoumentation or resources online that will help us in our project. For instance, implementing a text-to-speech or speech-to-text feature is a very complex thing to do, so utilizing resources online could definitely make it easier for us.
