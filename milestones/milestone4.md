## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
The team communicated effectively on Slack in order to complete the required features of the app. Each member has defined roles, such that we all contributed in many different ways and we brought new ideas into the discussion that would not have been possible if we weren't communicating. We also utilized the project board very well, so each member knows what needs to be done.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
Some of the features of the app were very difficult to implement that it took a lot of time for us to create the next features. For instance, before we can implement the speech-to-text feature, we need to implement the feature where the users submit an input response. There were many steps to implement this feature, but the team prevailed and we were able to implement it on time.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?
We finished most of the planned tasks for this week. The task that we didn't finish this week was the speech-to-text feature, which was understandable because that is a difficult task to create. We will still try our best to implement this feature. We will move that task for the sprint for next week because while we didn't finish all of the tasks for this week's sprint, we also completed some of the tasks that are due for next week's sprint.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
The speech-to-text feature might be "at risk" because of the difficulty of implementing this feature. The reason is that there are a lot of paid libraries out there that would easily implement that feature for us, but we are not willing to pay money. If we decide to code this our own, the feature wouldn't be that advanced and it will take a lot of time. We will still try to find other solutions before the deadline.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We might need access to certain docoumentation or resources online that will help us in our project. For instance, implementing a text-to-speech or speech-to-text feature is a very complex thing to do, so utilizing resources online could definitely make it easier for us.
