Reference the Writing User Stories final project guide in the course portal for more information about how to complete each of the sections below.

## Outline User Roles

1. Aspiring Software Engineer (User) - The main user of the app who practices coding problems, system design, and behavioral interviews to prepare for software engineering roles.
2. Administrator -  Responsible for managing the app's overall functionality, user data, and ensuring system stability.
3. AI Interviewer - An AI-enabled role that simulates an interviewer, providing coding problems, behavioral questions, and performance feedback to the user.

## Draft User Stories

1. As a user, I want to practice solving coding problems, so I can improve my technical interview skills.
2. As a user, I want to receive instant feedback on my coding solution, so I can understand what I did right or wrong.
3. As a user, I want to simulate the entire interview process, so I can get accustomed to the real interview experience.
4. As a user, I want to track my interview history, so I can review my past sessions and identify where I need improvement.
5. As a user, I want to see my progress over time, so I can evaluate my strengths and weaknesses.
6. As a user, I want to practice with different programming languages, so I can be prepared for diverse technical interviews.
7. As a user, I want to receive feedback on the time and space complexity of my solution, so I can improve my algorithmic efficiency.
8. As a user, I want to practice coding under timed conditions, so I can improve my performance in real-time interviews.
9. As a user, I want to receive a performance score at the end of each interview session, so I can evaluate my overall performance.
10. As a user, I want to access interview practice at any time, so I can prepare for interviews on my own schedule.
